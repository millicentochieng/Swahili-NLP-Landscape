# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Research on Swahili Language
**Swahili**, also **Kiswahili**, is a Bantu language and the native language of the Swahili people. It is spoken by 120 – 150 million people across East and Southern Africa. Originates from Bantu languages of the coast of East Africa (Pokomo, Taita and Mijikenda languages etc.). Opinions vary, however, about 20% of the Swahili vocabulary is derived from loan words. The vast majority Arabic, but also other contributing languages, including Persian, Hindustani, Portuguese, German & Malay. It is an official language in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda & Rwanda and is recognized as a minority language in DRC, Burundi & Mozambique.

This work is not a masterpiece however, it entails related works revolving around NLP research on Swahili language including;

i) NLP tasks on Swahili Language.

ii) Available datasets on Swahili Language.

iii) NLP Models trained on Swahili language.
